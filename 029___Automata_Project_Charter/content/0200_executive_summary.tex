This project charter outlines the plan for implementing a tailored Odoo Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system for Automata System Integration Solution (Automata). The primary goal is to enhance Automata's operational capabilities by integrating and streamlining its financial, procurement, and inventory management processes. This initiative aims to move Automata from its current reliance on isolated Excel spreadsheets to a unified, efficient, and transparent system.

This document details three critical areas for the project:

    \item \textbf{Project Scope and Objectives:}
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet, itemsep=0.2em, leftmargin=*]
        \item Define the boundaries of the Odoo ERP implementation, focusing on Invoicing, Accounting, Inventory, Purchase, and Sales modules.
        \item Establish clear project objectives, including enhanced financial transparency, optimized procurement and supply chain, streamlined inventory operations, integrated departmental workflows, and support for data-driven decision-making.
        \item Specify key deliverables such as a fully customized Odoo system, migrated master data, custom reports, and comprehensive user training.
        \item Clarify out-of-scope items, such as extensive historical data migration and development of entirely new modules not part of the standard Odoo suite.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Organizational Context:}
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet, itemsep=0.2em, leftmargin=*]
        \item Identify key stakeholders from Automata, Scando Integrated Solutions, and Odoo, detailing their roles and responsibilities.
        \item Outline the project's governance structure, including the Project Sponsor, Steering Committee, and Project Management Team.
        \item Acknowledge the importance of change management to ensure smooth adoption of the new system and processes by Automata staff.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Project Plan and Approach:}
    \begin{itemize}[label=\textbullet, itemsep=0.2em, leftmargin=*]
        \item Present a phased implementation approach, from initial planning and requirements gathering through to deployment, go-live, and post-implementation monitoring.
        \item Provide a high-level project timeline with key milestones for each phase.
        \item Recognize the resources required from both Automata and Scando Integrated Solutions for successful project execution.
        \item Briefly touch upon risk considerations and the need for ongoing management.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

The success of this Odoo ERP implementation will be measured by its ability to provide Automata with a robust platform that supports its growth, improves operational efficiency, ensures financial accountability, and empowers its leadership with timely insights for strategic decision-making. This charter serves as the foundational agreement for all project stakeholders.
