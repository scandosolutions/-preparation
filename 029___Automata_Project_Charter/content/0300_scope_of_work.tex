\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Out of Scope}
The following items and activities are explicitly out of scope for this project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Historical Transactional Data Migration:} Migration of detailed historical transactional data beyond the agreed-upon cut-off strategy for opening balances and master data.
    \item \textbf{Third-Party Integrations (unless specified otherwise):} Integration with external systems not explicitly detailed and agreed upon in the final technical offer (e.g., bespoke Automata systems, non-standard banking interfaces beyond basic statement import capabilities if not covered by standard Odoo features or agreed connectors).
    \item \textbf{Development of New Odoo Modules:} Creation of entirely new Odoo applications or modules that are not part of the standard Odoo Enterprise suite or not specified as a custom development deliverable in the technical offer.
    \item \textbf{Hardware and Network Infrastructure:} Procurement, installation, or management of any client-side hardware, network infrastructure, or internet connectivity. Automata is responsible for ensuring adequate end-user devices and internet access for the Odoo Online platform.
    \item \textbf{Ongoing Operational Data Entry:} Data entry into the Odoo system after the go-live and initial data migration will be the responsibility of Automata staff.
    \item \textbf{Extensive Business Process Re-engineering (BPR):} While process optimization is part of the Odoo implementation, a full-scale, standalone BPR engagement beyond what is necessary for adapting Automata's processes to Odoo best practices is not included.
    \item \textbf{Physical Asset Tagging and Tracking:} While the inventory module will manage inventory records, the physical tagging of assets is not in scope.
    \item \textbf{Statutory Audit and Legal Advisory Services:} The project does not include the provision of external audit services or legal advice regarding compliance. The system will be configured to support compliance based on requirements provided by Automata.
    \item \textbf{Content Creation for Website Module (if applicable):} If the Website module were in scope (currently listed as out of scope in the technical offer's application list for Automata), the creation of website content (text, images, videos) would be Automata's responsibility.
    \item \textbf{Management of Automata's Odoo Online Subscription:} Automata will be responsible for its direct subscription and licensing relationship with Odoo.
\end{itemize}
